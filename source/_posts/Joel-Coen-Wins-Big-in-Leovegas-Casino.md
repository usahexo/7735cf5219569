#  Joel Coen Talks Roulette Strategy at Leovegas Casino

If you're looking for a little bit of insight into how to play roulette, you could do worse than to listen to Joel Coen. The Oscar-winning Coen brothers filmmaker was recently interviewed by online casino Leovegas, and during the course of the chat he dropped a few tips on how best to play the game.

Coen started by discussing the different types of bets that can be made in roulette. "There are basically two types of betting in roulette," he said. "There's inside betting, which is when you bet on numbers, either specific or combinations of them; and then there's outside betting, which is when you bet on things like colours or whether the ball will land in a certain section of the wheel."

He recommends beginners start by making outside bets, as they're easier to win and provide a steadier return than inside bets. "I would definitely start with outside bets," Coen advised. "They're simpler to understand and more likely to come up with a winning result."

When it comes to placing your bets, Coen says it's important to think about your odds of winning. "You want to make sure that whatever bets you're making offer good odds," he said. "For example, betting on red or black usually offers odds of around 1:1, whereas betting on a specific number pays out at 35:1. So if you're not confident about picking the right number, I'd suggest sticking with colours."

Coen also had some words of wisdom for those who like to change their bets during a game. "I wouldn't recommend doing that," he said. "The chances are that if you've put money on one particular type of bet and it's not coming in, changing your bet isn't going to help."

Finally, Coen had some advice for those playing online roulette. "Make sure you check out the rules of the game before you start playing," he said. "Every casino has its own set of rules, so it's important that you know what they are before you start placing any bets."

#  How Joel Coen Turned $10 into $1,000 at Leovegas Casino

It was a lucky day for Joel Coen when he decided to visit the Leovegas Casino. He started with just $10 and quickly turned it into a healthy $1,000 payday. How did he do it?

Coen first started off by playing the NetEnt slot game “Gonzo’s Quest”. This 20-payline game is based on the conquistadors of South America, and offers players the chance to win up to 720,000 coins. Coen managed to land some big wins on this game, which helped to boost his bankroll significantly.

He then moved on to play “Jimi Hendrix”, a new slot game from NetEnt that is based on the life and music of the legendary guitar player. This game offers players 243 ways to win, and Coen took advantage of this by landing some big payouts. In the end, his total bets came to €10 which resulted in a nice €1,000 payout.
