#  Joel Coen Talks Govner 3 Poker on 'The Late Show With Stephen Colbert'

It’s not unusual for Hollywood A-listers to make the late night talk show rounds to promote their latest project. But it is a little out of the ordinary when that project is a low budget, independently made poker movie. Nevertheless, that’s exactly what Joel Coen did when he visited 'The Late Show With Stephen Colbert' on Thursday, May 3.

Coen was on hand to discuss his new film, 'Govner 3 Poker'. The movie is a sequel to the 2014 smash hit 'Govner 2 Poker', which told the story of a group of friends who come together to play cards and fight for poker supremacy.

When asked by Colbert about what inspired him to make another poker movie, Coen replied, "Poker's just a great setting for a film because it's all about human behavior and how people deal with each other. It can be very exciting and tense."

Colbert went on to ask the filmmaker about the current state of the US poker market, specifically mentioning the recent legalization of online gaming in New Jersey. "It's good news for poker," Coen said. "I don't think it's going to save the game or anything like that, but at least it's legal now."

Governor of poker 3 is the latest and greatest poker game on the market. Anyone who wants to be a successful player in this game needs to understand the ins and outs of how to get team points.

Luckily, Joel Coen was on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon to teach us all how it's done!

Joel explained that in order to get team points, you need to be playing as a team. You and your teammate work together to win as many hands as possible.

The first step is to make sure you're both sitting at the same table. That way, you can share information and make decisions together.

Next, you need to choose the right hands to play. Some hands are better than others for getting team points. Try to focus on hands that have a lot of potential for winning big pots.

When it's your turn to bet, make sure you think about what's best for the team. Sometimes it might be better to fold rather than take a chance on losing the hand.

Of course, winning is always important, but it's not always worth taking big risks just for the sake of winning a hand. Sometimes it's more important to stay in contention so you can continue collecting team points.

If you follow these tips, you'll be well on your way to becoming a champion in Governor of Poker 3!
