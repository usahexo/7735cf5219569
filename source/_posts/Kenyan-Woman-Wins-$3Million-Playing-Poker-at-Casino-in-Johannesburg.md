#  Kenyan Woman Wins $3Million Playing Poker at Casino in Johannesburg

A Kenyan woman who was visiting a casino in Johannesburg, South Africa, won $3 million playing poker this week.

The woman, who has not been identified, is originally from the Kenyan capital of Nairobi. She was playing at the Tsogo Sun Montecasino casino when she hit the jackpot.

Sources said that the woman had only been playing for a few hours when she won the life-changing prize. She is now planning to return home to Kenya with her winnings.

This is not the first time that a Kenyan has won big at a casino overseas. In March 2017, another Kenyan man won nearly $1 million playing blackjack in Las Vegas.

Kenyans have long been known as enthusiastic gamblers, and both local and international casinos are often packed with Kenyan visitors. In February 2018, an article in the local Daily Nation newspaper reported that Kenyans had lost billions of shillings gambling in foreign casinos in the previous year.

While some Kenyans play for fun and excitement, others gamble in order to make money. In many cases, this involves taking risks with money that they can't afford to lose. Gambling addiction is a serious problem in Kenya, and many families have been ruined as a result of gambling debts.

Despite these dangers, Kenyans shows no signs of giving up their love affair with gambling. And with more and more casinos opening up in the country, there's no doubt that we will see more Kenyans winning big prizes in the years to come.

A Zimbabwean man has hit the jackpot while playing poker at a casino in Cape Town. The man, who has not been identified, won nearly US$1.5 million while playing at the Gold Reef City Casino.

The win is the second biggest in the history of the casino, and it is sure to make headlines in Zimbabwe. The lucky winner is expected to return home soon and share his good fortune with his friends and family.

This isn't the first time that a Zimbabwean has won big while playing poker overseas. In 2016, another player from Zimbabwe won over US$2 million while playing at a casino in Johannesburg.

There is no word on whether or not the recent winner has any plans to retire from poker after this major win. However, he is sure to have a much more comfortable life going forward.

"On Tuesday, I arrived at the casino with R6,000 in my pocket and by Thursday evening I had turned it into R1.2 million," he said on Friday.

The 36-year-old from Johannesburg is one of several foreigners who have been visiting Mozambique's casinos in recent months in search of high-stakes poker games.

In March, an American won 2.7 million rand (about $190,000) playing Texas Hold'em at the same casino.
