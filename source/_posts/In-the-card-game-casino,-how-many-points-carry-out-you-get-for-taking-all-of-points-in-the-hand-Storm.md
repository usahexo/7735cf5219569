Here is how the scoring works in the game of Storm. The basic idea is to score points by taking as many cards as possible to go out. The first player to reach 100 points or more wins the game.

Cards numbered 2 through 9 are worth face value, while aces are worth 1 point and 10s are worth 0 points. So, for example, if you take all 5 cards in a hand (Ace through 5), you would score 5 points.

#  What is the value of a point in hand Storm?

In the game of poker, points in hand (or "pips") are determined by counting the number of cards in the player's hand that are worth face value. The Ace is worth 1 point, 2 through 10 are worth face value, and the Jack, Queen and King (J,Q,K) are each worth 10 points. This gives a total of 40 points in a typical hand.

Some casinos will award an extra point if the player has an Ace-King combination (A♥ K♥), for a total of 41 points. In some variations of poker (e.g., Caribbean Stud Poker), a 5-card hand is also counted, with Ace being 1 point and all other card values according to rank.

The value of a point in hand can be important in determining how much to bet or raise during the course of play. For example, if one player has 39 points and another has 41 points, the first player would be at a disadvantage because they only have 3 more potential points in their hand.
