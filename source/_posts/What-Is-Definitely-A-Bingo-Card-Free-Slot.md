The notion of bingo is really very simple. There are five columns and five rows on the card, each with 25 squares. Players cover squares as numbers are called until one player has completed a line horizontally, vertically or diagonally. Those playing can either buy cards for a set price from the house, or make their own card with purchased markers. Generally, bingo is played by adults in social situations, often as part of fundraising activities.

There are all sorts of variations on how bingo is played, including blackout games where the object is to cover all 75 squares on the card and progressive jackpot games where the prize pot keeps growing until someone wins. And while the classic game of bingo is still going strong, online bingo has taken off in recent years with players logging in from around the world to participate in some serious gaming action.
