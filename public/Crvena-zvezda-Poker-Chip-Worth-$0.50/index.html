<p>The Prva Srpska Poker Liga was founded in 2016, and it is sponsored by the Asocijacija Poker Srbija (APS), which is the governing body for poker in Serbia. The league has two primary objectives: to promote poker as a legitimate form of entertainment among Serbians, and to raise money for charity. Its stated goal is “to popularize this card game not only as an entertaining hobby but also as an opportunity to make some easy money.”</p>
<p>The inaugural season of the Prva Srpska Poker Liga kicked off in September 2016 with 15 clubs competing in two divisions (an open division and a ladies division). The season ran until May 2017, with clubs playing a total of 113 matches across both divisions. At the end of the season, Crvena zvezda emerged as champions of the open division, while Napredak Rubin clinched first place in the ladies division.</p>
<p>To commemorate their victory, Crvena zvezda produced a limited run of 10,000 commemorative poker chips emblazoned with their club crest logo. These chips are currently being sold online for €4.50 (US$5.00) apiece.</p>
