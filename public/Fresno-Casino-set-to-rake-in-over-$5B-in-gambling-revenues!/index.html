<h1 id="Casino-gambling-revenues-soar-in-Fresno"><a href="#Casino-gambling-revenues-soar-in-Fresno" class="headerlink" title="Casino gambling revenues soar in Fresno!"></a>Casino gambling revenues soar in Fresno!</h1><p>Residents and visitors of Fresno are gambling more at casinos, as reported by the California Gambling Control Commission. Casino gambling revenues in Fresno totaled $1.2 billion in 2017, up from $1.1 billion in 2016. The increase is attributed to a rise in slot machine spending.</p>
<p>The city with the next-highest revenue was Sacramento, with $746 million. Reno was in third place with $644 million, and Los Angeles was fourth with $532 million. Slot machine revenue made up 95% of Fresno’s casino gambling revenue.</p>
<p>Fresno’s largest casino is Table Mountain Casino, which generated $506 million in revenue in 2017. That’s up from the $487 million it generated in 2016. The second-largest casino is Thunder Valley Casino Resort, which generated $471 million last year.</p>
<p>While some may worry about the impact of gambling addiction on individuals and families, the economic benefits for communities that host casinos are clear. In addition to increased tax revenue, casinos create jobs and generate spending in the surrounding area.</p>
<h1 id="Fresno-Casino-leads-the-way-in-gambling-revenue-growth"><a href="#Fresno-Casino-leads-the-way-in-gambling-revenue-growth" class="headerlink" title="Fresno Casino leads the way in gambling revenue growth"></a>Fresno Casino leads the way in gambling revenue growth</h1><p>The Fresno casino is leading the pack in gambling revenue growth according to industry experts. The casino, which is located in central California, has seen its gambling revenue grow by a whopping 25% in the past year. This makes it one of the top performers in terms of gambling revenue growth in the United States.</p>
<p>The reasons for the casino’s success are varied. Firstly, the casino has invested heavily in new and innovative games, which has helped to draw in gamblers. Secondly, the casino has also invested heavily in its marketing efforts, and this has paid off with an increase in visitor numbers. Finally, the casino has also been successful in terms of its customer service, which has helped to keep players coming back.</p>
