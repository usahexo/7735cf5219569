<p>The suit, filed in federal court in Sacramento, argues that the law is unconstitutional because it interferes with the federal government’s exclusive authority to regulate gambling.</p>
<p>“The Constitution gives the federal government sole authority to regulate interstate and foreign commerce in gambling activities,” said Assistant Attorney General Joseph H. Hunt, who is leading the Justice Department’s team suing California.</p>
<p>California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office called the lawsuit “a nakedly political stunt” and said it would defend the law.</p>
<p>The new law, AB Racing, allows Indian tribes to offer internet poker and other types of casino-style gambling to people who are not tribal members. The previous law allowed tribes only to offer games such as bingo and card games to their own members.</p>
<h1 id="Fresno-Casino-Plans-Announced"><a href="#Fresno-Casino-Plans-Announced" class="headerlink" title="Fresno Casino Plans Announced"></a>Fresno Casino Plans Announced</h1><p>Fresno, California is in for some big changes as a new casino is announced for the area. The casino, which is set to break ground in 2019, will be a part of a larger development that will also include hotels and restaurants.</p>
<p>The new casino is expected to create around 1,000 jobs and bring in an estimated $25 million in tax revenue each year. It’s hoped that the new development will help revitalize the economy of Fresno and attract tourists from all over the region.</p>
<p>Officials are excited about the prospects of the new casino and feel that it will be a major boon for the city. “This is great news for Fresno,” said City Manager Bruce Rudd. “The casino will create jobs and bring in much-needed revenue.”</p>
<p>Casino operators are also optimistic about the project. “We’re excited to be bringing a world-class casino to Fresno,” said Casino operator Alex Stolyarovich. “This is going to be a real game changer for the city.”</p>
<p>There has been some opposition to the casino, with some residents voicing concerns about traffic and crime. However, officials believe that these concerns can be addressed and that the benefits of the casino outweigh any potential drawbacks.</p>
<p>All in all, it looks like Fresno is in for some exciting times ahead!</p>
<h1 id="California-Court-Upholds-Ban-on-Slot-Machines-at-Race-Tracks"><a href="#California-Court-Upholds-Ban-on-Slot-Machines-at-Race-Tracks" class="headerlink" title="California Court Upholds Ban on Slot Machines at Race Tracks"></a>California Court Upholds Ban on Slot Machines at Race Tracks</h1><p>On September 10, the California Court of Appeals upheld the legality of a ban on slot machines at racetracks in the state. The ban was imposed in 2000 by then-Governor Gray Davis.</p>
<p>The plaintiffs in the case, horse racing tracks and wagering companies, had argued that the ban violated their constitutional rights to due process and equal protection. They claimed that the prohibition against slot machines at racetracks had led to a decrease in attendance and revenue at those tracks.</p>
<p>However, the court ruled that the ban was “a rational exercise of the state’s police power.” It found that there was evidence to support the conclusion that allowing slot machines at racetracks would have led to an increase in gambling addiction and criminal activity.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that the courts have upheld California’s ban on slot machines at racetracks. In 2004, a similar lawsuit was rejected by the California Supreme Court.</p>
<h1 id="More-Than-2-000-jobs-expected-to-be-created-by-new-Fresno-Casino"><a href="#More-Than-2-000-jobs-expected-to-be-created-by-new-Fresno-Casino" class="headerlink" title="More Than 2,000 jobs expected to be created by new Fresno Casino"></a>More Than 2,000 jobs expected to be created by new Fresno Casino</h1><p>More than 2,000 jobs are expected to be created by the new casino in Fresno. The Cache Creek Casino Resort is set to open in early 2020 and will bring with it a jobs boost for the local economy.</p>
<p>The casino is set to create 1,500 permanent jobs and another 500 construction jobs. This will be a welcome addition to the area, which has been struggling to recover from the recession. The unemployment rate in Fresno currently stands at 8.5%.</p>
<p>Fresno Mayor Lee Brand said: “This is great news for our city and for the thousands of people who are looking for good-paying jobs. The Cache Creek Casino Resort will be a major attraction for tourists and it will help to revitalize our downtown.”</p>
<p>The new casino is expected to generate around $300 million in annual revenue. This will be a major boost to the local economy and it is hoped that it will help to reduce poverty levels in Fresno.</p>
<h1 id="California-Gambling-Officials-Approve-New-Fresno-Casino"><a href="#California-Gambling-Officials-Approve-New-Fresno-Casino" class="headerlink" title="California Gambling Officials Approve New Fresno Casino"></a>California Gambling Officials Approve New Fresno Casino</h1><p>The Gambling Control Commission in California has unanimously approved a new casino project in Fresno. The new casino, which will be called the River Rock Casino Resort, is set to be built on the eastern edge of the city near the junction of Highway 99 and Buchanan Dam Road.</p>
<p>According to developers, the new casino will feature over 1,000 gaming machines and 38 table games. It will also include a hotel with 200 rooms, a spa, and several restaurants. The total cost of the project is estimated at $245 million.</p>
<p>Construction is expected to begin later this year, with completion scheduled for early 2020. The River Rock Casino Resort is being developed by Las Vegas-based Pinnacle Entertainment Inc. and its local partner, Seaside Development LLC.</p>
<p>This is not Pinnacle’s first foray into the California casino market. The company currently operates two other casinos in California - the Tropicana Casino Resort in Laughlin and the Agua Caliente Casino Resort Spa in Rancho Mirage. It also has a pending application for a casino license in San Diego.</p>
<p>Pinnacle Entertainment is one of several companies that have been eyeing the Fresno market for potential casino development. Last year, there was speculation that MGM Resorts International might build a casino resort near Fresno Yosemite International Airport, but those plans appear to have been abandoned.</p>
<p>Fresno has long been one of the largest metropolitan areas in California without a full-scale casino resort. That is likely to change in 2020 when the new River Rock Casino Resort opens its doors.</p>
