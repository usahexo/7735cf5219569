<p>“Bovada’s success in this study is a testament to their commitment to providing an exceptional customer experience,” said Evan Cardwell, Director of Marketing at PlayNJ.com. “From their prime location in Atlantic City to their swift shuttle service, Bovada has raised the bar for what players can expect from a New Jersey online casino.”</p>
