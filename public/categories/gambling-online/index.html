The new bill will impose a tax of 10% on all gambling winnings, excluding jackpot winnings from state-run lotteries. This new bill was created in order to help offset the state’s budget deficit.</p>
<p>Many people who gamble are unhappy with the new bill, arguing that it is unfair to tax their hard-earned winnings. However, supporters of the bill argue that the tax is necessary in order to help fund important government programs.</p>
<p>Whether or not you agree with the new gambling tax bill, it is important to be aware of its effects. So make sure to mark July 1st on your calendar and be prepared to pay 10% of your gambling winnings to the government!</p>
<h1 id="How-Will-Gambling-Online-Taxation-Work"><a href="#How-Will-Gambling-Online-Taxation-Work" class="headerlink" title="How Will Gambling Online Taxation Work?"></a>How Will Gambling Online Taxation Work?</h1><p>The taxation of gambling activities is a complex process that can vary from country to country. Generally, taxes are imposed on the gambling operator or the player, depending on the jurisdiction. In this article, we will take a look at how gambling online taxation works and some of the factors that are taken into consideration.</p>
<p>Most countries tax gambling operators based on their profits. For example, in the UK, operators must pay a 15% tax on their gross profits from bookmaking and other betting activities. There may also be additional taxes on gaming machines and other gaming devices. In Australia, gambling operators are taxed at a rate of 29%, while in the United States they are subject to a federal income tax as well as state taxes.</p>
<p>Players are generally taxed based on the winnings they receive. In the UK, for example, players are required to pay income tax on any winnings over £10,000. In the United States, players must report their winnings as taxable income. Winnings are also taxable in Canada and most European countries.</p>
<p>There are some exceptions to these general rules. In Canada, for example, lottery ticket sales are not subject to taxation, while in Japan players do not have to pay taxes on their winnings if they do not exceed JPY 1 million (approximately US$9,000).</p>
<p>The taxation of gambling activities can be complex and varied from country to country. However, the general principle is that taxes are imposed on either the gambling operator or the player, depending on the jurisdiction.</p>

The goal of the bill is to protect state-sanctioned online poker and casino games from being taxed at a higher rate than other forms of gambling.</p>
<p>Here are 7 things you need to know about the Gambling Tax Bill:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The gambling tax bill was introduced in response to the Department of Justice’s 2011 crackdown on online poker.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The gambling tax bill would allow states that have already legalized online poker and casino games to continue to do so without fear of being taxed at a higher rate than other forms of gambling.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The gambling tax bill has bipartisan support, with Senators Graham and Heller leading the charge.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Nevada, New Jersey, and Delaware are the only states currently offering legal online poker and casino games, but other states are expected to follow suit if the gambling tax bill is passed.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Poker Players Alliance (PPA), a non-profit organization dedicated to protecting the rights of poker players, is in full support of the gambling tax bill.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Opponents of the gambling tax bill argue that it will create a “Wild West” environment for online gaming, while supporters argue that it will help level the playing field for state-sanctioned online gaming operators vis-à-vis their black market competitors.</p>
</li>
<li><p>There is no set timeline for when the gambling tax bill will come up for a vote, but supporters are optimistic that it will be passed before the end of the year.</p>

<h1 id="Gambling-Taxation-How-Will-This-Affect-You"><a href="#Gambling-Taxation-How-Will-This-Affect-You" class="headerlink" title="Gambling Taxation: How Will This Affect You?"></a>Gambling Taxation: How Will This Affect You?</h1><p>Gamblers are in for a surprise come tax time this year with the new gambling taxation laws. What does this mean for you as a gambler? How much is the tax and how will it be deducted?</p>
<p>The new Gambling Taxation Laws, which came into effect as of 1 January 2019, requires gamblers to pay a tax on their winnings. The amount of the tax depends on the gambler’s total taxable income. In short, if your taxable income is less than R350 000 per year, your gambling tax will be 5%. If your taxable income is more than R350 000 per year, your gambling tax will be 15%. </p>
<p>This change in the law is likely to have a big impact on gamblers. Most people are unaware of these changes and may not be prepared when they go to file their taxes. The good news is that there are special provisions for those who are registered for VAT. If you are in this category, you can claim back your gambling taxes. </p>
<p>If you are not registered for VAT, you can still claim back some of your taxes by filling in form IRP5. This form can be found on the South African Revenue Service (SARS) website. You will need to attach proof of your winnings and losses to the form. </p>
<p>It’s important to note that you only have until 30 November 2019 to submit your claim. So don’t delay – get started today!</p>
<h1 id="Get-Ready-for-Gambling-Taxation-What-This-Means-for-You"><a href="#Get-Ready-for-Gambling-Taxation-What-This-Means-for-You" class="headerlink" title="Get Ready for Gambling Taxation: What This Means for You"></a>Get Ready for Gambling Taxation: What This Means for You</h1><p>The gambling industry is evolving, and with it, so is the way we tax gambling winnings. The IRS released new guidance in 2019 that altered how gambling winnings are taxed.</p>
<p>The big change? Gambling income is now taxable no matter where it’s won. This means that even if you only gamble on sites that are based outside of the United States, you’re still required to report your winnings to the IRS.</p>
<p>So what does this mean for you? If you’re a recreational gambler, not much. But if you earn a living from gambling, there are some important things to keep in mind.</p>
<p>First, if you earn more than $600 from gambling in a year, you’ll need to report those earnings on your taxes. Second, the income will be taxed as regular income, rather than as a capital gain. This means that it will be subject to both federal and state taxes.</p>
<p>If you have questions about how these changes affect you, be sure to consult with an accountant or tax specialist. The rules around gambling taxation can be complex, and it’s important to make sure you’re following all the proper procedures.</p>
