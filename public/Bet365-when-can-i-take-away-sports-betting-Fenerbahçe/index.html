<h1 id="Fenerbahce’s-next-opponent-revealed"><a href="#Fenerbahce’s-next-opponent-revealed" class="headerlink" title="Fenerbahçe’s next opponent revealed"></a>Fenerbahçe’s next opponent revealed</h1><p>After the departure of Portuguese superstar Cristiano Ronaldo, all eyes have been on Juventus to see how they will perform this season. Cristiano’s former club, Real Madrid, have also been under close scrutiny as they attempt to fill the void left by the five-time Ballon d’Or winner.</p>
<p>However, there has been another team in Serie A quietly going about their business and building a strong squad; that team is Fenerbahçe.</p>
<p>The Istanbul-based club have been one of the busiest teams in the transfer market this summer, signing nine new players including Van Der Wiel, Hasan Ali Kaldırım, and Brazilian striker Fernandao.</p>
<p>Fenerbahçe’s latest signing was revealed on Wednesday as 21-year-old defender Şener Özbayraklı joined from Trabzonspor. The move is seen as a major coup for Fenerbahçe as Özbayraklı was linked with moves to Valencia, Atletico Madrid and Juventus this summer.</p>
<p>Manager Aykut Kocaman was delighted with the signing and said “Şener is a young player with a lot of potential. He is someone who can contribute to our defence and I am sure he will be a success at Fenerbahçe.”</p>
<p>Fenerbahçe’s next opponents in the Champions League were also revealed on Wednesday as they were drawn against Greek side AEK Athens in Group D. The first fixture between the two sides will be played at the Olympic Stadium in Athens on September 18th.</p>
<h1 id="Can-Bet365-withdrawal-money-during-a-match"><a href="#Can-Bet365-withdrawal-money-during-a-match" class="headerlink" title="Can Bet365 withdrawal money during a match?"></a>Can Bet365 withdrawal money during a match?</h1><p>Yes, you can. However, the amount you are able to withdraw will be lower than your original stake.</p>
<p>For example, if you bet £10 on a match and it’s 5 minutes into the game, you will only be able to withdraw £5. If the match finishes in full however, you will be able to withdraw your original £10 stake.</p>
<h1 id="Murat-Ozturk-‘It’s-not-over-until-it’s-over’"><a href="#Murat-Ozturk-‘It’s-not-over-until-it’s-over’" class="headerlink" title="Murat Öztürk: ‘It’s not over until it’s over’"></a>Murat Öztürk: ‘It’s not over until it’s over’</h1><p>In sport, there is a popular saying that goes “It’s not over until it’s over.” This is a mantra that Turkish basketball player Murat Öztürk lives by.</p>
<p>Growing up in the eastern province of Erzurum, Öztürk was always determined to make it big in basketball. At the age of 16, he left his home and family behind to move to Istanbul and pursue his dream of playing in the top league in Turkey.</p>
<p>Öztürk endured many hardships along the way. He often had to sleep on the floor of friends’ apartments because he could not afford rent. He also had to take whatever odd jobs he could find to support himself so that he could continue to train and improve his skills as a basketball player.</p>
<p>Undeterred by the obstacles in his path, Öztürk kept working hard and eventually made it onto the roster of one of Turkey’s top teams. Over the past several years, he has become one of the best players in the Turkish league, leading his team to numerous championships.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Öztürk achieved his ultimate goal when he signed with a team in the NBA, America’s premier professional basketball league. Although he is still adjusting to the faster and more physical style of play in the NBA, Öztürk is confident that he can be successful in America and eventually help his team win a championship.</p>
<p>“It’s not over until it’s over,” says Öztürk. “I have faced many challenges in my life, but I have never given up. I will continue to work hard and prove myself at every opportunity.”</p>
<h1 id="Fenerbahce-hoping-for-first-win-of-the-season"><a href="#Fenerbahce-hoping-for-first-win-of-the-season" class="headerlink" title="Fenerbahçe hoping for first win of the season"></a>Fenerbahçe hoping for first win of the season</h1><p>Fenerbahçe is a professional Turkish football club based in Istanbul, Turkey. The club was formed in 1907, they play their home games at the Şükrü Saracoğlu Stadium. As of October 2018, they are the ninth most successful club in terms of domestic trophies with 23 trophies.</p>
<p>Fenerbahçe has won a record 19 Turkish Super Cups, 15 first division championships and 5 Turkish Cups. They reached the semi-finals of the 2007–08 UEFA Champions League and the semi-finals of the 2009–10 UEFA Europa League. The clubs also became the first and only team to ever reach the UEFA Cup&#x2F;Europa League final in two consecutive seasons. Fenerbahçe is also the first Turkish club to enter the group stage of the Champions League.</p>
<p>The club’s colours are yellow and navy, while their crest depicts a phoenix rising from flames. The club has a long-standing rivalry with Galatasaray, as well as a lesser rivalry with Beşiktaş.</p>
<p>The season started off with high hopes for Fenerbahçe as they were runner-ups in both competitions last year. However, they have not been able to win any of their matches as of yet. They started off their season by playing against Kasımpaşa and lost 2-1; then played against Bursaspor and lost 1-0; then played against Göztepe and lost 2-1; then played against Giresunspor and drew 2-2; then played against Istanbul Basaksehir and lost 3-0; then played against Trabzonspor and lost 2-1; then played against Antalyaspor and drew 0-0. Their next match will be on October 20th against Akhisar Belediye Genclik ve Spor Kulubu which they will hopefully win.</p>
