      <h1 id="Kenyan-Woman-Wins-3Million-Playing-Poker-at-Casino-in-Johannesburg"><a href="#Kenyan-Woman-Wins-3Million-Playing-Poker-at-Casino-in-Johannesburg" class="headerlink" title="Kenyan Woman Wins $3Million Playing Poker at Casino in Johannesburg"></a>Kenyan Woman Wins $3Million Playing Poker at Casino in Johannesburg</h1><p>A Kenyan woman who was visiting a casino in Johannesburg, South Africa, won $3 million playing poker this week.</p>
<p>The woman, who has not been identified, is originally from the Kenyan capital of Nairobi. She was playing at the Tsogo Sun Montecasino casino when she hit the jackpot.</p>
<p>Sources said that the woman had only been playing for a few hours when she won the life-changing prize. She is now planning to return home to Kenya with her winnings.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that a Kenyan has won big at a casino overseas. In March 2017, another Kenyan man won nearly $1 million playing blackjack in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>Kenyans have long been known as enthusiastic gamblers, and both local and international casinos are often packed with Kenyan visitors. In February 2018, an article in the local Daily Nation newspaper reported that Kenyans had lost billions of shillings gambling in foreign casinos in the previous year.</p>
<p>While some Kenyans play for fun and excitement, others gamble in order to make money. In many cases, this involves taking risks with money that they can’t afford to lose. Gambling addiction is a serious problem in Kenya, and many families have been ruined as a result of gambling debts.</p>
<p>Despite these dangers, Kenyans shows no signs of giving up their love affair with gambling. And with more and more casinos opening up in the country, there’s no doubt that we will see more Kenyans winning big prizes in the years to come.</p>
<h1 id="Zimbabwean-Man-Hits-Jackpot-for-Nearly-US-1-5M-Playing-Poker-at-Casino-in-Cape-Town"><a href="#Zimbabwean-Man-Hits-Jackpot-for-Nearly-US-1-5M-Playing-Poker-at-Casino-in-Cape-Town" class="headerlink" title="Zimbabwean Man Hits Jackpot for Nearly US$1.5M Playing Poker at Casino in Cape Town"></a>Zimbabwean Man Hits Jackpot for Nearly US$1.5M Playing Poker at Casino in Cape Town</h1><p>A Zimbabwean man has hit the jackpot while playing poker at a casino in Cape Town. The man, who has not been identified, won nearly US$1.5 million while playing at the Gold Reef City Casino.</p>
<p>The win is the second biggest in the history of the casino, and it is sure to make headlines in Zimbabwe. The lucky winner is expected to return home soon and share his good fortune with his friends and family.</p>
<p>This isn’t the first time that a Zimbabwean has won big while playing poker overseas. In 2016, another player from Zimbabwe won over US$2 million while playing at a casino in Johannesburg.</p>
<p>There is no word on whether or not the recent winner has any plans to retire from poker after this major win. However, he is sure to have a much more comfortable life going forward.</p>
<h1 id="Gambler-Turns-R6-000-into-R1-2-Million-at-Durban-Casino-Pokers-Table"><a href="#Gambler-Turns-R6-000-into-R1-2-Million-at-Durban-Casino-Pokers-Table" class="headerlink" title="Gambler Turns R6,000 into R1.2 Million at Durban Casino Pokers Table"></a>Gambler Turns R6,000 into R1.2 Million at Durban Casino Pokers Table</h1><p>Durban - A regular at the Durban casino says he turned his R6,000 into R1.2 million playing poker this week.</p>
<p>The 52-year-old self-employed man says he has been gambling for about 10 years but had never before won such a large sum.</p>
<p>“On Tuesday, I arrived at the casino with R6,000 in my pocket and by Thursday evening I had turned it into R1.2 million,” he said on Friday.</p>
<p>The man, who asked not to be named, said the secret to his success was keeping a level head and not panicking when he lost money. “I just kept cool and played the odds.”</p>
<p>He said he would now take a break from gambling and spend some time with his family.</p>
<h1 id="South-African-Wins-R3-Million-Playing-Poker-at-Casino-in-Mozambique"><a href="#South-African-Wins-R3-Million-Playing-Poker-at-Casino-in-Mozambique" class="headerlink" title="South African Wins R3 Million Playing Poker at Casino in Mozambique"></a>South African Wins R3 Million Playing Poker at Casino in Mozambique</h1><p>Casino officials in Mozambique say a South African man has walked away with 3 million rand, or about $215,000, after winning a poker game.</p>
<p>The unnamed player was taking part in a tournament at the Casino do Estoril in the capital Maputo on Saturday when he bested his rivals, according to a statement from the gambling venue.</p>
<p>The 36-year-old from Johannesburg is one of several foreigners who have been visiting Mozambique’s casinos in recent months in search of high-stakes poker games.</p>
<p>In March, an American won 2.7 million rand (about $190,000) playing Texas Hold’em at the same casino.</p>
<h1 id="Namibian-Takes-Down-R1-8-Million-playing-Poker-at-North-West-Casino"><a href="#Namibian-Takes-Down-R1-8-Million-playing-Poker-at-North-West-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Namibian Takes Down R1.8 Million playing Poker at North West Casino"></a>Namibian Takes Down R1.8 Million playing Poker at North West Casino</h1><p>The Namibian Poker player, who has chosen to remain anonymous, was playing at the North West Casino when he hit the big one. He was playing Texas Hold’em Poker and managed to beat the odds and take down R1.8 million from the casino.</p>
<p>The player is originally from Windhoek but now resides in Johannesburg. When asked what his plans were for the money, he said that he would invest some of it and use the rest to set up a new business.</p>
<p>“I’m very happy with my winnings. I’ve been playing poker for a few years now and this is my biggest win yet,” said the player. “I’ll be investing some of it and using the rest to set up a new business.”</p>
<p>This is not the first time that a Namibian has won big at a casino. In 2016, another player took down R2 million from Sun City Casino.</p>
